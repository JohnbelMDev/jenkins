  API tokens offer a way to make authenticated CLI or REST API calls. See
  <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/api-token">our wiki</a>
  for more details.
  <br />
  The username associated with each token is your Jenkins username.

  Some good practices for keeping your API tokens secure are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Use Unique Tokens per Application:</strong> Assign a unique token to each application. This allows for individual token revocation if an application is compromised, reducing potential security risks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Regularly Regenerate Tokens:</strong> Regenerate tokens every 6 months or as per security requirements. Jenkins shows indicators for token age to prompt timely updates.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Protect Tokens as You Would Passwords:</strong> Tokens allow access with your Jenkins privileges. Safeguard them as securely as you would passwords to prevent unauthorized access.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Monitor Token Usage:</strong> Keep track of token usage. Jenkins provides the last use date and usage count for each token, assisting in identifying and revoking unused or compromised tokens.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Revoke Unused Tokens:</strong> Regularly review and revoke tokens that are no longer in use to reduce the attack surface by eliminating unnecessary active tokens.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Implement Strong Access Controls:</strong> Ensure only authorized users create and manage tokens. Use Jenkins' role-based access control for effective permission enforcement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Keep Jenkins Updated:</strong> Regularly update Jenkins and plugins to the latest versions to ensure security patches for known vulnerabilities are applied.
    </li>
  </ul>

    Every time Jenkins is restarted, creation dates for unused legacy tokens reset, which may lead to inaccurate dates.
